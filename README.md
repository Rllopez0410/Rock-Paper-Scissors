# Rock-Paper-Scissors

# This game was one of the projects from the Odin Projects fundations course. The purpose of this project is to insure that students do understand and use some of the basic concepts of the javascript programming language. For example, DOM munipulation, if/else statements, data types, the node tree, scope and loops.
